    I like javascript and I like hacking; sometimes I like to hack other people's work and I do so with bookmarklets.
    Bookmarklets allow you to make modifications to websites via javascript.
    Bookmarklets encourage the same philosophy as
    %a{:href => "http://http://www.greasespot.net"} greasemonkey
    except you and your users don't need to install greasemonkey to modify web sites, bookmarklets are natively supported by the browser.
