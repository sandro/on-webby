          I've been underutilizing my 
          %a{:href => "http://slicehost.com"} slice
          so I thought I'd use webby as a temporary solution while I get my slice in order.
          %strike
            I need to upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu and install the standard mod rails stack.
            %a{:href => "http://github.com/sandro/capify_slicehost/tree/master"}
              (see how I did it).
          When I get through with that I can finally start hosting some of my web experiments
          and over time create a rails blog that I'm happy with.
          Until then, enjoy the speed of static content.
